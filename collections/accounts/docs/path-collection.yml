  summary: Add a new account
  description:  |
    This endpoint allows the authenticated user to add a new OAuth
    2.0 provider account to her API user account.
    
    The `provider` can be `google`, `github`, or `discord`. This
    indicates that the accompanying `token` came from a successful
    OAuth 2.0 authorization using that provider (Google,
    GitHub, or Discord; note that with Google, itâ€™s the _ID_ token
    that should be sent to this endpoint, but for GitHub or Discord
    you should send the _access_ token).
    
    The same data can be supplied to the `POST /v1/auth/tokens`
    endpoint to create a new authentication token, but that endpoint
    creates a new user with the given account. This endpoint adds
    the account to an already-established and authenticated user,
    allowing users to associate multiple OAuth 2.0 accounts to their
    single user account, giving them the ability to authenticate as
    the same user through multiple OAuth 2.0 providers.
