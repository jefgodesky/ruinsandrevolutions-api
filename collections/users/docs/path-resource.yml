  summary: Delete a single user

    The user selected by `userId` is deleted. This is an irreversible
    hard delete, so clients implementing this endpoint should warn
    the user before sending the request. For a reversible soft
    delete, consider using `DELETE /users/{userId}/roles/{role}` to
    remove the `active` and `listed` roles.
    You must be authenticated to use this endpoint, as you can only
    delete your own user account unless you have the administrator
    role.
