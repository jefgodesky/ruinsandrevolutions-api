    methods:
      description: |
        This field describes the various ways that the table could
        be rolled. For example, the standard _Taking Action_ table
        can be rolled normally (`2d6 + Ability`), with advantage
        (`3d6kh2 + Ability`) or with disadvantage (`3d6kl2 + Ability`).
        Many tables will just have one, but this is defined as a
        dictionary to support more complex use cases.
        
        If you have a method with the key `normal`, that will be used
        by default (when no other method is specified). Otherwise the
        first method will be used.
