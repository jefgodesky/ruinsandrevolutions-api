    - Authentication
  summary: Authenticate
  description: |
    This is the authentication endpoint. It can be used in one of two
    ways: by providing a `provider` and `token` to get a new JWT
    authentication token, or by providing an existing JWT
    authentication token to get a new one.
    
    In the first mode, `provider` can be `google`, `github`, or
    `discord`. This indicates that the accompanying `token` came from
    a successful OAuth 2.0 authorization using that provider (Google,
    GitHub, or Discord; note that with Google, it’s the _ID_ token
    that should be sent to this endpoint, but for GitHub or Discord
    you should send the _access_ token).
    
    If you have used this account to authenticate before, you will
    receive a new JWT authorization token tied to that user and
    account. If not, a new user and account will be created with the
    information from that token (_see_ `POST /v1/users/{id}/accounts`
    for how to attach additional accounts to the same user).
    
    JWT authentication tokens expire after 10 minutes, so rather than
    putting users through another OAuth 2.0 authorization flow every
    10 minutes, the other way to use this endpoint is to refresh an
    expired (or soon to expire) JWT authentication token for a new
    one. Each token has a new refresh code, and so long as you have
    the _latest_ issued JWT, you can continue refreshing it for new
    tokens for up to 7 days before the user has to go through the
    OAuth 2.0 authorization flow again. To use the endpoint in this
    way, skip the `provider` attribute and pass the JWT
    authentication token as `token`.
